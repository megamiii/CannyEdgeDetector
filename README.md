# CannyEdgeDetector-
This repository houses an implementation of the Canny Edge Detection algorithm, a multi-stage process to detect a wide range of edges in images. It includes Gaussian blurring, gradient calculation with Sobel operators, non-maximum suppression, and applies double thresholding and hysteresis for edge tracking.
